// The merging logic is somewhat involved, so it will be summarized here.

//  First, we compare the K values of the unioner and the source sketch.

//  if source.K < unioner.K, we reduce the unioner's K to match, which
//  requires downsampling the unioner's internal sketch. 

//  Here is how to perform the downsampling.
//  If the unioner contains a bitMatrix, downsample it by row-wise OR'ing.
//  If the unioner contains a sparse sketch, then create a new empty
//  sketch, and walk the old target sketch updating the new one (with modulo).
//  At the end, check whether the new target
//  sketch is still in sparse mode (it might not be, because downsampling
//  densifies the set of collected coupons). If it is NOT in sparse mode, 
//  immediately convert it to a bitmatrix.

// At this point, we have source.K >= unioner.K.
// [We won't keep mentioning this, but in all of the following the
// source's row indices are used mod unioner.K while updating the unioner's sketch.
// That takes care of the situation where source.K > unioner.K.]

// Case A: unioner is Sparse and source is Sparse. We walk the source sketch
// updating the unioner's sketch. At the end, if the unioner's sketch
// is no longer in sparse mode, we convert it to a bitmatrix.

// Case B: unioner is bitmatrix and source is Sparse. We walk the source sketch,
// setting bits in the bitmatrix.

// In the remaining cases, we have flavor(source) > Sparse, so we immediately convert the
// unioner's sketch to a bitmatrix (even if the unioner contains very few coupons). Then:

// Case C: unioner is bitmatrix and source is Hybrid or Pinned. Then we OR the source's
// sliding window into the bitmatrix, and walk the source's table, setting bits in the bitmatrix.

// Case D: unioner is bitmatrix, and source is Sliding. Then we convert the source into
// a bitmatrix, and OR it into the unioner's bitmatrix. [Important note; merely walking the source
// wouldn't work because of the partially inverted Logic in the Sliding flavor, where the presence of
// coupons is sometimes indicated by the ABSENCE of rowCol pairs in the surprises table.]

/****************************************/

// How does getResult work?

// If the unioner is using its accumator field, make a copy of that sketch.

// If the unioner is using its bitMatrix field, then we have to convert the
// bitMatrix back into a sketch, which requires doing some extra work to
// figure out the values of numCoupons, offset, firstInterestingColumn, and KxQ.
